# CIFAR10 dataset neural network
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the CIFAR10 dataset then after that I am doing classification on it using neural networks by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Making some conclusions about the data.
4. classification using neural networks with:
    - callbacks:
        - early stopping.
        - model checkpoint.
    - Batch normalization.
    - Selu activation function.
    - regularization techniques:
        - Alpha dropout.
        - MC dropout.
    - learning schedule:
        - 1cycle scheduling.
